//	Algorithm for determining assistants in the assassination. The default is ADVANCED (1).
//		CSSTATSX (0) — CSSTATSX — Equivalent to CSstatsX.
//		ADVANCED is an improved and fairer formula that chooses from a number of other assistants
//  who has dealt the most damage victim and whose percentage of damage from the total damage
//  from all is at least DAMAGE_FOR_ASSIST percent.
//
aka_algorithm "1"

//	 Universal damage value. Its value is determined by the aka_algorithm.
//
aka_damage "30.0"

//	If the value is positive, the player who assisted in the kill will be credited with a frag.
//
aka_frag "1"

//	How much money to pay to the assisted player. Payment will be made only if the specified value is greater than zero.
//
aka_money "100"

//	How much AES experience to give to the assisted player.
//
aka_exp "0"

// Display a chat message to the player who assisted in the kill. The message template is contained in data/lang/next21_kill_assist.txt.
//
aka_chatmessage "1"

//	Special inserts supported:
//		[award]  — Money kill reward equal to aka_money. Output without the '$' character.
//		[exp] 	 — Experience kill reward equal to aka_exp. Only works with AES.
//		[killer] — Killer player nickname.
//		[victim] — Victim player nickname.
//	The [exp] value only works with aka_exp > 0 and AES activated, and the [award] value only works with aka_money > 0.
//	Otherwise, an empty value will be displayed.
//
// Requires compilation with aes_v.inc in the include directory.
